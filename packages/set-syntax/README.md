# Set Syntax

The Set Syntax Atom package creates easy Command Palette entries for setting the syntax of the current file.

It is designed to make the transition to Atom easier for people migrating from Sublime Text by mimicking the method by which one changes the syntax of the current buffer in that editor.

## Installation

This package can be installed from Settings by searching for `set-syntax` or can be installed from the command line by using the command: `apm install set-syntax`.

## Use

Simply use the way you're used to in Sublime Text!

## Configuration

There is nothing to configure.

### Key Bindings

There are no key bindings set by default, though you could set keys for specific languages that you use often. For example:

```coffee
'.editor:not(.mini)':
  'alt-cmd-Z': 'set-syntax:ruby'
```
