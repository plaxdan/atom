It provides an easy-on-the-eyes backdrop for your code, with well balanced typography, whitespace and contrast.\n\n![flat background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-light-ui/raw/master/resources/images/flat.png)\n\n![gradient background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-light-ui/raw/master/resources/images/gradient.png)\n\n![image background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-light-ui/raw/master/resources/images/image.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- Automatically adapts to your favourite syntax theme\n- Tweaks [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap), [color-highlight](https://atom.io/packages/atom-color-highlight), [web-browser](https://atom.io/packages/web-browser) (more to come)\n- Looks awesome in [Distraction free mode](https://atom.io/packages/distraction-free-mode)\n- Configurable!\n\n\n## Configuration\n\n**You may need to reload atom before settings become available ([settings-view #347](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/347))**\n\n- Choose from a number of fonts included in this theme or match the editor's font.\n- Select hip 'thin' fonts, or trusty old 'regular'\n- Choose between a flat or gradient background.\n- Or even use any image as background (from your computer or [the internets](http://hubblesite.org)).\n- Make the layout take up less vertical space (e.g. for small screens).\n- Choose low contrast tooltips (or fancy colorful ones).\n- Change font-sizes for the entire UI (everything will scale to fit) by putting this in your stylesheet:\n\n```\nhtml, body { font-size: 9px; }\n```\n\n\n## Fonts\nThis package includes a number of fonts that were designed especially for user interfaces. You can pick and choose without having to find and install anything:\n\n- Cantarell - the system font for GNOME 3 (by Dave Crossland)\n- Clear Sans - Intel's new font (by Daniel Ratighan)\n- Fira Sans - the system font for Firefox OS (by Carrois and Edenspiekermann)\n- Open Sans - because we â™¥ Open Sans (by Steve Matteson)\n- Oxygen - the system font for KDE (by Vernon Adams)\n- Roboto - the new font for Android (by Christian Robertson)\n- Source Sans Pro - Adobe's UI font also used in Brackets (by Paul D. Hunt)\n- Ubuntu - Ubuntu's system font (by Dalton Maag)\n- System default - Attempts to match your OS using this stack: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Ubuntu, Cantarell, sans-serif\n\n## Plans\n\n- Tweak and improve stuff for specific packages\n- Use it every day\n- [Make it better almost every day](https://github.com/braver/isotope-light-ui/issues/2)\n\nThanks to [@simurai](https://github.com/simurai) for the work on the [one-dark-ui](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui) theme that Isotope was forked from.\n",
