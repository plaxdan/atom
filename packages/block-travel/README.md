# Block travel package

Block travel uses empty lines to travel quickly
through blocks of code.

* `alt-up` to travel up through blocks of code
* `alt-down` to travel down through blocks of code
* `alt-shift-up` to travel and select up through blocks of code
* `alt-shift-down` to travel and select down through blocks of code

If you're wondering what the theme is, it's
[Code School](https://atom.io/packages/code-school).
