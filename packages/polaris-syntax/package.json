  "readme": "# polaris-syntax theme\n\nPolaris is an Atom syntax theme designed to make coding clear, elegant, and enjoyable. A unique palette was chosen that clearly identifies important parts of your code, but is not distracting and allows you to craft your applications with pleasure.\n\nThe theme was designed with Atom's built in One Dark UI, but will also translate nicely with many other UI themes. I intend to make incremental updates to the theme as I improve it, but the general scheme will stay the same. Enjoy.\n\n![Polaris screenshot](https://mir-cdn.behance.net/v1/rendition/wip/fs/a9a8db1805125.54ee652d1cbb1.png)\n",
