# DataSplice Client Architecture

`Action(payload)` -> `Dispatcher` -> `Store(payload)` -> `React`


An alternative flow that:

- treats the `UserActionFactory` more like a traditional stateless service (`UserActionService`)
- treats the UserStore more like a traditional view-model

..could be:

- View calls `UserActionServic.createUser(formData);`
- `UserActionService` performs client-side validation of form data
