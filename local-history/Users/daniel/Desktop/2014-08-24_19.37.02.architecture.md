# DataSplice Client Architecture

`Action(payload)` -> `Dispatcher` -> `Store(payload)` -> `React`


- View calls UserActionFactory.validateUser(userFormData)
- UserActionFactory
- UserActionFactory.validateUser uses whatever resources necessary to validate the user
- If the form data is valid then


An alternative flow that:

- treats the `UserActionFactory` more like a traditional stateless service (`UserActionService`)
- treats the UserStore more like a traditional view-model

..View calls `UserActionService.createUser(formData);` and pseudocode would be:

```coffeescript

# Uses UserService to validate / persist users
# Views and user behavior results in calls to the action factory
# the action factory binds the service layer to the dispatcher
UserActionFactory:
  validateUser: (formData) ->

  createUser: (validFormData) ->
    Promise.when(userService.createUser(validFormData))
      # could fail due to a number of reasons
      #   validation error, or maybe database unavailable etc
      .fail((errorPayload) ->
        dispatch(USER_CREATION_ERROR, errorPayload))

      .done((newlyCreatedUser) ->
        dispatch(USER_CREATION_SUCCESS, newlyCreatedUser))

# This is the ui-agnostic service layer.
# The core client-side business logic in your app.
UserService:
  createUser: (formData) ->
    # Client-side validation
    clientSideValidationResult = _validateUser(formData)
    if clientSideValidationResult is null
      # send to server for persistence
      # server also validates and may respond with error
      result = serverApi.createUser(formData)
      if result.error
        dispatch(USER_CREATION_ERROR, result.error)
      else
        dispatch(USER_CREATION_SUCCESS, result)
    else
      dispatch(USER_CREATION_ERROR, clientSideValidationResult)

  disableUser: (userId, reason) ->
  deleteUser: (userId) ->
  # etc...

# Subscribes to actions and their payloads
# Behaves like a view-model
UserStore:

  # validationError, database unavailable, no internet connection
  #   details are in the payload
  onUserCreationError: (errorPayload) ->

  # yay, change the store to reflect that
  onUserCreationSuccess: (newUserPayload) ->
```
