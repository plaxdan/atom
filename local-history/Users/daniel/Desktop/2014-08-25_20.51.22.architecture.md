# DataSplice Client Architecture

Unidirectional data flow:

```
            Service Layer
             Ʌ        |
             |        V
View -----> ActionCreator --> (action) ----> Dispatcher ---> (registered callback) --------+
Ʌ                                                                                          |
|                                                                                          |
|                                                                                          V
+------ (View "change" event handlers) <--- (Stores emit "change" events) <---- Store -----+
```
The following cycle is continually repeated:

```
+---> Component ->
|       ActionCreator <---> Service
|         Dispatch ->
|           Action ->
|             Store -+
|                    |
+--------------------+
```

# Stores

## HomeScreenActionsStore

- `getHomeScreenActions` - contains all the HomeScreenActions json as the main dataset
- `getHomeScreenActionCategories` - extracts just the categories from the main data set
