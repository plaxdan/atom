`Action(payload)` -> `Dispatcher` -> `Store(payload)` -> `React`


An alternative flow that:

- treats the `UserActionFactory` more like a traditional stateless service (`UserActionService`)
- treats the UserStore more like a traditional view-model

..View calls `UserActionService.createUser(formData);` and pseudocode would be:

```coffeescript
createUser: (formData) ->

  validationErrors = validate(formData)

  if (validationErrors is null) {
    # Let the UI know we're working on it...
    #   show spinner, disable submit button etc
    dispatch(CREATING_USER)

    # This could be a long running task
    Promise.when(createUser(formData))
      .fail((errorPayload) -> dispatch(CREATION_FAILED, errorPayload))
      .done((newlyCreatedUser) -> dispatch(CREATED_USER, newlyCreatedUser))
  else
    errorPayload =
      formData: formData,
      validationErrors: validationErrors

    # Tell the UI what's wrong with the form data
    dispatch(INVALID_USER, errorPayload)
```
