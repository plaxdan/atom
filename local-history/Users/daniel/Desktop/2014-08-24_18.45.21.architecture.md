# DataSplice Client Architecture

`Action(payload)` -> `Dispatcher` -> `Store(payload)` -> `React`


- View calls UserActionFactory.validateUser(userFormData)
- UserActionFactory
- UserActionFactory.validateUser uses whatever resources necessary to validate the user
- If the form data is valid then


An alternative flow that:

- treats the `UserActionFactory` more like a traditional stateless service (`UserActionService`)
- treats the UserStore more like a traditional view-model

..View calls `UserActionService.createUser(formData);` and pseudocode would be:

```coffeescript

# Coarse grained service for user business logic
UserService:
  createUser: (formData) ->
  fetchUsers: (query) ->
  deleteUser: (userId) ->
  # etc...

# Uses UserService to validate / persist users
UserActionFactory:
  validateUser: (formData) ->

  createUser: (validFormData) ->
    Promise.when(userService.createUser(validFormData))
      # could fail due to a number of reasons
      #   validation error, or maybe database unavailable etc
      .fail((errorPayload) -> dispatch(USER_CREATION_ERROR, errorPayload))

      .done((newlyCreatedUser) -> dispatch(USER_CREATION_SUCCESS, newlyCreatedUser))

# subscribes to actions and their payloads
# behaves like a view-model
UserStore:

  # validationError, database unavailable, no internet connection
  #   details are in the payload
  onUserCreationError: (errorPayload) ->

  # yay, change the store to reflect that
  onUserCreationSuccess: (newUserPayload) ->

```
