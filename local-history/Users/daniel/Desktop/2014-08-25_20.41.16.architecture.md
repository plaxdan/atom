# DataSplice Client Architecture

Unidirectional data flow:

```
            Service Layer
             Ʌ        |
             |        V
View -----> ActionCreator --> (action) ----> Dispatcher ---> (registered callback) --------+
Ʌ                                                                                          |
|                                                                                          |
|                                                                                          V
+------ (View "change" event handlers) <--- (Stores emit "change" events) <---- Store -----+
```
The following cycle is continually repeated:

```
Component ->
  ActionCreator -> Service
    Dispatch ->
      Action ->
        Store ->
Component ->
  ActionCreator -> Service
    Dispatch ->
      Action ->
        Store ->
Component ->
  ActionCreator -> Service
    Dispatch ->
      Action ->
        Store ->
```
