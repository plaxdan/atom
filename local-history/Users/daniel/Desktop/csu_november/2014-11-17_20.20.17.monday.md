## Current Usage

- Dell laptops kept in backpacks in trucks
- Use those devices for Maximo (e-forms for emergency service calls)
- Average 425 work orders per week

- Planner analyst uses S4 to put fence around pipes that need cleaning in accordance with PM schedule

- S4 uses the PM to generate work orders

- 6 trucks 2 people per truck
  - clean each basin in the city in response to parent work order
  - people charge time to parent
  - each line cleaned, users write the work order number and a date-completed on the packet
    - Renee receives the paperwork and she data-entries it into Maximo
      - Work orders remain open until the paperwork is done by Renee
      - They'd like to be able to close these sooner
  - People in the field are having to generate their own work orders in the field (with paperwork)
    - This often falls through the cracks (CM in the field)
