## Desired ESRI Plugin Features

- Fetch ESRI layer by name (because indexes change over time)
- Import default styling from ESRI service
- Import default zoom levels (thresholds) from ESRI service?

# Afternoon

## Current Usage

- Dell laptops kept in backpacks in trucks
- Each field user (because of time entry historically) is a Maximo user
- Laptops have wireless network cards (has been a hassle in the past)
- Use those devices for Maximo (e-forms for emergency service calls)
- Average 425 work orders per week

- Planner analyst uses S4 to put fence around pipes that need cleaning in accordance with PM schedule

- S4 uses the PM to generate work orders

- 6 trucks 2 people per truck
  - clean each basin in the city in response to parent work order
  - people charge time to parent work order
    - Follow up work (CM) orders to the child Work Order
  - each line cleaned, users write the work order number and a date-completed on the packet
    - Renee receives the paperwork and she data-entries it into Maximo
      - Work orders remain open until the paperwork is done by Renee
      - They'd like to be able to close these sooner
- create follow-up WOs in the field

### GIS

- Some information to communicate to the end user exists in the GIS system. E.g.:
  - low pressure cleaning
  - location of flow meters
  - which lines we don't clean
  - (full list of these items to follow)

## Future

- Maximo attachments

## Use Case Doc Comments from People In Room

- Log entries are limited to 100 characters...my concern is that we have enough space to enter detailed information. Especially for emergencies, or service calls.
  - Matt: the summary is lmited yes, but the description allows more
- Should we have a date/time calendar on the date fields
- Going from NEW-COMP is that still OK?
  - This may change but to start they thought they'd keep the process the same

## Crew Assignment

- One person in the crew is the Crew Lead to which the work orders / time / schedule is assigned
