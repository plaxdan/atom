## Desired ESRI Plugin Features

- Fetch ESRI layer by name (because indexes change over time)
- Import default styling from ESRI service
- Import default zoom levels (thresholds) from ESRI service?

# Afternoon

## Current Usage

- Dell laptops kept in backpacks in trucks
- Each field user (because of time entry historically) is a Maximo user
- Laptops have wireless network cards (has been a hassle in the past)
- Use those devices for Maximo (e-forms for emergency service calls)
- Average 425 work orders per week

- Planner analyst uses S4 to put fence around pipes that need cleaning in accordance with PM schedule

- S4 uses the PM to generate work orders

- 6 trucks 2 people per truck
  - clean each basin in the city in response to parent work order
  - people charge time to parent work order
    - Follow up work (CM) orders to the child Work Order
  - each line cleaned, users write the work order number and a date-completed on the packet
    - Renee receives the paperwork and she data-entries it into Maximo
      - Work orders remain open until the paperwork is done by Renee
      - They'd like to be able to close these sooner
- create follow-up WOs in the field

### GIS

- Some information to communicate to the end user exists in the GIS system. E.g.:
  - low pressure cleaning
  - location of flow meters
  - which lines we don't clean
  - (full list of these items to follow)

## Use Case Doc Comments from People In Room

- Log entries are limited to 100 characters...my concern is that we have enough space to enter detailed information. Especially for emergencies, or service calls.
  - Matt: the summary is lmited yes, but the description allows more
- Should we have a date/time calendar on the date fields
- Going from NEW-COMP is that still OK?
  - This may change but to start they thought they'd keep the process the same

## Crew Assignment

- One person in the crew is the Crew Lead to which the work orders / time / schedule is assigned
- One crew would work an entire basin which would take from one day to three weeks. The parent basin work orders are therefore the ones that would be assigned to the crew leads
- Field crew usually consists of two employees. Both have time charged against them for the parent work order

PM = assigning a basin for cleaning (PM contains child work orders)
FPM = assign single word order to crew lead (no children)

## Crew Evaluation

- Crews are evaluated by average daily footage cleaned
- Some pipes are abandoned, and work is not done then the work order is still marked as COMP but notes are added to say "abandoned"
  - opportunity to create follow-up work order to inspect and verify that a segment is truly abandoned (possibly using CCTV)

## Field data

- Field Crews are spending a lot of time clicking on each segment, looking at the length, and then manually adding up the total lengths to record:
  - gas / water usage statistics (total cost per footage)
- Footage done so far is used to predict how much longer the crew will have to be in the basin (based on average footage per hour)


## Possible new Idea - Prompt at the end:
- time
- water fuel
- other crew member
- calculate footage
