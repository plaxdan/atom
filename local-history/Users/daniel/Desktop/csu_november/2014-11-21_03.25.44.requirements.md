# CSU WasteWater DataSplice

## Back Story

CSU is responsible for maintaining the wastewater pipes across Colorado Springs. Wastwater pipes have a manhole at each end and are sloped. The wastewater pipes must be inspected and cleaned on a regular basis. Wastewater pipes are cleaned "uphill" meaning the manhole at the bottom of the slope is the entry point and the manhole at the top is the exit point for a given section of pipe.

The city of Colorado Springs is divided into geographical areas known as basins. Each basin contains several manholes and sections of pipe. A section of pipe is considered to be within a basin if its entry manhole lies within the basin (even if the exit manhole crosses a border into another basin.)

### PM Work Orders

- PM Work Orders map 1:1 with a Basin
- A child Work Order exists for each segment of pipe within the basin
- All labor is against the parent PM Work Order
