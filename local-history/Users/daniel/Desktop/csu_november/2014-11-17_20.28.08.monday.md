## Current Usage

- Dell laptops kept in backpacks in trucks
- Each field user (because of time entry historically) is a Maximo user
- Laptops have wireless network cards (has been a hassle in the past)
- Use those devices for Maximo (e-forms for emergency service calls)
- Average 425 work orders per week

- Planner analyst uses S4 to put fence around pipes that need cleaning in accordance with PM schedule

- S4 uses the PM to generate work orders

- 6 trucks 2 people per truck
  - clean each basin in the city in response to parent work order
  - people charge time to parent work order
    - Follow up work (CM) orders to the child Work Order
  - each line cleaned, users write the work order number and a date-completed on the packet
    - Renee receives the paperwork and she data-entries it into Maximo
      - Work orders remain open until the paperwork is done by Renee
      - They'd like to be able to close these sooner

## GIS

- Some information to communicate through logs exists in the GIS system. e.g.:
  - low pressure cleaning
  - location of flow meters
  - which lines we don't clean
