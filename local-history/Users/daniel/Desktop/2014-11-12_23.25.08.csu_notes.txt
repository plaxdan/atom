Wants to move some of the development in-house to have changes happen in accordancw with their calendar. If we don't hit our testing windows and have no control over when development work gets done then it causes problems for our users.

Our crews want Maximo and they want GIS (also Sharepoint documents)

Want to be able to observe status of issues

# CEF Client Issues

Using version 5.1.x of DataSplice ...white screen of death
iTunes client

Michelle: when I ping you guys about the campmaster issue.
          Also it would be valuable just to let me know you've seen the ticket (even if you don't have a solution just yet)

Campmaster case-sensitivity changed between the older and newer versions of the CampMaster plugin. We used DBA skills in house to manage the data.
Campmaster had a breaking change.

If I get 5.2.3 I know it'll work with iPad/iPhone etc.
ESRI has standardized on a version for utilities that doesn't change for 2-3 years. They'll get service packs for bug fixes.
The reason is that it's really expensive for utilities to deal with upgrades.
Perhaps we need to follow ESRI's release schedule with our own plugins.

Question: do you use a load balancer to distribute users between instances of DataSplice
