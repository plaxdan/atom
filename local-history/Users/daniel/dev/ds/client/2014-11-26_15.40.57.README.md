# DataSplice HTML5 Client

## Gulp Tasks

The DataSplice client uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build the application.
The following top-level tasks are available:

### `gulp run`
Runs a development server that hosts the application and dynamically watches for changes.
The following arguments can be specified:
- `--proxy <DataSplice service>` forwards web service requests to the specified server instance
- `--listenport <port>` runs the web server (defaults to 4180)
- `--nouglify` does not minify the loader script and shared libraries (the application files are not minified by default)
- `--nowebsql` prevent WebSQL data adapters from loading even if platform supports it
- `--trace` turns on fine-grained trace debugging

### `gulp run:skel`
Runs a development server that watches for changes with the app skeleton scripts.
The `run` task builds these files statically, so this can be used to work on the loader UI, etc.

### `gulp test`
Build the application and run the command line unit tests

### `gulp build`
Builds the application
- `--nouglify` suppress minifying scripts and stylesheets

### `gulp dist`
Create distributable versions
- `--distpath <path>` specifies an alternate location for the dist output, otherwise things are copied to `./dist`
- `--webapppath <path>` specifies an alternate location for the webapp output, which is useful for Cordova and CEF environments. Defaults to `./build/webapp`

### `gulp clean`
Delete intermediate files
- `--distpath <path>` specifies an alternate location for the dist output. This argument can be specified multiple times to clean different output folders (CEF, Cordova)
