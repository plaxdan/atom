# Leaflet GIS Plugin for DataSplice

Provides the ability to dynamically render GIS feature data on a map using Leaflet.

### Developing This Plugin

Run the DataSplice Client

    cd /Users/<you>/projects/datasplice-client
    gulp run --proxy http://10.211.55.4:4180

    cd /Users/<you>/projects/datasplice-plugin-leaflet
    gulp clean && gulp dist --distpath=../datasplice-client/build/ --nouglify --sourcemap

Either run this plugin (passing the `distpath` flag) to see mocha tests:

    gulp run:web --distpath=../datasplice-client/build/debug

Or run  watch if you're not interested in the mocha tests

    gulp watch --distpath ../datasplice-client/build/debug


## Continuous Integration

By default the plugin will dist to

    ~/dist/Server/Resources/WebClient/plugins/datasplice-plugin-leaflet

On the CI server the contents of `dist` are consumed and added to a zip file which can be dropped onto an instance of DataSplice.

## Development

During development you'll most commonly want to distribute the plugin to a local instance of the datasplice-client using `--distpath`:


    cd /Users/<you>/<projects>/datasplice-client
    gulp run --proxy http://10.211.55.4:4180
    gulp clean && gulp dist --distpath=../datasplice-client/build/ --nouglify --sourcemap

The `--nouglify` and `--sourcemap` are available for debugging.

If the plugin is running with run:server You should now be able to work with both the plugin and client running concurrently:

> Plugin: [http://localhost:3000/test.html](http://localhost:3000/test.html)

> Client: [http://localhost:4180](http://localhost:4180)
