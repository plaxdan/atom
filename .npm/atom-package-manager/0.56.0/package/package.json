The major difference is that `apm` sets multiple command\nline arguments to `npm` to ensure that native modules are built against\nChromium's v8 headers instead of node's v8 headers.\n\nThe other major difference is that Atom packages are installed to\n`~/.atom/packages` instead of a local `node_modules` folder and Atom packages\nare published to and installed from to GitHub repositories instead of\n[npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org)\n\nTherefore you can think of `apm` as a simple `npm` wrapper that builds on top\nof the many strengths of `npm` but is customized and optimized to be used for\nAtom packages.\n\n## Installing\n\napm is bundled and installed automatically with Atom.\n\n## Building\n  * Clone the repository\n  * Run `npm install`\n  * Run `grunt` to compile the CoffeeScript code\n  * Run `npm test` to run the specs\n\n## Using\n\nRun `apm help` to see all the supported commands and `apm help <command>` to\nlearn more about a specific command.\n\nThe common commands are `apm install <package_name>` to install a new package,\n`apm featured` to see all the featured packages, and `apm publish` to publish\na package to [atom.io](https://atom.io).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/atom/apm","_id":"atom-package-manager@0.56.0","_shasum":"d8d676fd4e7c7caa513443ea671becc901626d2c","_from":"atom-package-manager@0.56.0","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/atom-package-manager/-/atom-package-manager-0.56.0.tgz"}
