The status-bar component is installed and enabled by default by Atom, so you don't need to worry about it.\n\n# Settings\n\nThe one and only setting is present in the Settings tab in Atom, there you can\nchoose if you want to display the size in Kibibyte Representation (base 1024) or\nif you want to show the size in Kilobyte Representation (base 1000).\n\nThe default behavior is show the size in Kibibyte Representation, if you want to\nchange this just uncheck the box in `Settings->Packages->filesize`.\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributing is easy, this is a small project so I'm accepting direct PRs and\nany kind of contribution you may have, today I'm focusing on improving test\ncoverage and making the package more robust and reliable.\n\nAny bugs? Please file an [issue](https://github.com/mkautzmann/atom-filesize/issues/)\n\nWanna fix it?
