You have to use these to get an alpha on the cursor, so setting an alpha on the `primaryColor` or `secondaryColor` doesn't do anything.\n\n### blink interval\n\nThe blinking interval of the cursor. Set to `0` to disable cursor blinking.\n\n### pulse duration\n\nA pulse effect that fades the cursor from `primaryColor` to `secondaryColor`. Set to 0 to disable.\n\n![Block cursor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olmokramer/atom-block-cursor/master/cursor-pulse.gif)\n\n### cursor thickness\n\nThe thickness of the non-block cursors.\n\n### cursor line fix\n\nWhen your syntax theme uses a `background-color` on `.cursor-line` - the line the cursor is on - the `block` cursor may become invisible. This is because the cursor has a `z-index` of `-1`, to make it render behind the text instead of above it. This fix sets the cursor's `z-index` to `1`, to make it render above the text, so you should use low `alpha` values for `primaryColor` and `secondaryColor` if you enable this fix.\n\n## known issues\n\n* Blink interval doesn't work in `mini` editors - the single line input fields, for example in settings - except for disabling blink.\n\n## contribute\n\nHave other neat ideas for cursor customization?
