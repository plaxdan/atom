The monokai light them was created for those of us who prefer, for whatever reason, themes with lighter backgrounds. This is a port of the [textmate version](https://github.com/rjfranco/monokai-light) that I had started in ages long past, and I plan to continue to support both, but figured they should be seperate repos so I could add this one to the atom repository.\n\nContributions and suggestions are very welcome.\n\n![A screenshot of your theme](http://rjfranco.github.io/atom-monokai-light/images/screen-shot.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rjfranco/atom-monokai-light/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/rjfranco/atom-monokai-light","_id":"monokai-light@0.3.7","_shasum":"4ecd4bf11da43142865f23657aa39a13ba358d5f","_resolved":"file:../d-115421-1130-yza31y/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115421-1130-yza31y/package.tgz"}
